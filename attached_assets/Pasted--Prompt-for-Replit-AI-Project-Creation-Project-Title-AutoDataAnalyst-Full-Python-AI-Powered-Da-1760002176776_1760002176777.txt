üß™ Example Workflow

User uploads a CSV file in Streamlit.

Backend (Python) auto-cleans it ‚Üí shows before/after summary.

User views insight cards: stats, correlations, outliers, etc.

You said:
use llama chatbot instead of open ai
ChatGPT said:

Got it! You want the same AutoDataAnalyst AI-powered data cleaning, insights, visualization app ‚Äî but instead of using OpenAI‚Äôs API (GPT-4/mini) for the chatbot, you want it fully Python-based using a LLaMA chatbot model.

Here‚Äôs a fully Python-based prompt for your project, swapping out the OpenAI API for a local LLaMA-based chatbot implementation.

üß† Prompt for Replit AI Project Creation (Python-based with LLaMA chatbot)
Project Title:

AutoDataAnalyst ‚Äì AI-Powered Data Cleaning, Insight, and Visualization Web App (LLaMA Chatbot)

üîç Goal

Build a full-stack AI web app that automatically cleans uploaded datasets (CSV/XLSX), generates insights, visualizes data interactively, and includes a local LLaMA-based chatbot to answer dataset-related questions ‚Äî all fully Python-driven with no external AI API calls.

Key insights: variable relationships, feature importance, trends.

Comparison analysis between columns.

Interactive Visualization Dashboard

Multiple dashboard styles: Summary, Correlation, Time-Series views.

üîß Additional Implementation Notes

LLaMA Chatbot Integration:
Use a local lightweight LLaMA inference solution (e.g., llama.cpp Python bindings, HuggingFace transformers with a smaller LLaMA checkpoint, or llama-index for data-augmented LLaMA queries).

Load dataset metadata and summaries as context prompt.

Implement retrieval or prompt engineering for accurate, data-driven responses.

Optionally fine-tune or embed dataset info with vector databases (e.g., FAISS).

Data Cleaning Module:
Implement automated pipelines using pandas and scikit-learn for: missing data imputation, outlier detection (e.g., IQR method), duplicates removal, normalization/scaling.

Visualization Generation:
Backend generates Plotly figures and serializes to JSON for frontend rendering or PNG images for downloads.

Frontend Chat UI:
Connects to backend /api/chat/query endpoint sending user question and receives streamed or complete LLaMA-generated response.
